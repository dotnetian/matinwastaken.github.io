In the 1990s, Visual Basic revolutionized programming by opening coding to the masses. But the 2000s brought the mighty C# that would eventually dethrone VB as king. This is the story of VB's meteoric rise and slow demise at the hands of C#.

## VB: Coding for the Common Man

In the early days of computing, languages like C and Pascal intimidated all but the most experienced coders. Visual Basic changed that in 1991 with visual tools and straightforward syntax that made programming radically simple.

VB introduced innovations like the drag-and-drop interface builder and intuitive English-like syntax. Features like buttons and menus enabled rapid GUI app development without intensive coding knowledge. 

Within years, VB became the most popular language, letting ordinary people build powerful Windows applications. It spearheaded concepts like events and controls that deeply influenced programming.

```vb
' VB Code Sample

Private Sub Button1_Click()
   MsgBox "Hello World"
End Sub 
```

VB enabled small businesses and amateurs to build apps like inventory systems and games that would've been impossible in C or Pascal. Its approachable coding style made it ideal for rapid prototyping and GUI development.

## C# Emerges as a Worthy Rival

VB continued dominating through the 90s with upgrades like VB 5 and 6. But in the 2000s, a powerful rival emerged - C#. Developed for Microsoft's .NET framework, C# combined the power of C++ with VB's ease of use.

As Microsoft positioned C# as the flagship .NET language, receiving new features first, many developers migrated from VB. C# quickly matched VB's capabilities while being praised for its clean, modern syntax.

```csharp
// C# Code Sample

Button1.Click += () => {
  MessageBox.Show("Hello World");
};
```

VB fell behind as Microsoft prioritized innovating C# with additions like LINQ and async programming. C# was widely adopted for web, game and application development, while VB retained a reputation as a relic.

## VB's Slow Demise in the Face of C#

While VB.NET evolved alongside C#, its usage declined as C# dominated enterprise development. Several factors contributed to VB's fall from grace:

1. **Modern features**: C# rapidly adopted new features like lambdas and type inference that VB took longer to integrate.

2. **User interface design**: VB's revolutionary drag-and-drop UIs became less important as design separated from coding.

3. **Legacy reputation**: VB was seen as dated while C# constantly innovated. Microsoft's .NET strategy prioritized C#'s growth.

Today VB is mostly used for maintaining legacy systems, while C# drives .NET development. Still, VB's influence on making programming accessible lives on through C# adopting VB philosophies like easy syntax and rapid UI development. 

## VB's Pioneering Legacy

While overtaken by C#, VB's legacy is still monumental. It opened programming to the masses and spearheaded visual rapid application development and easy syntax.

Concepts pioneered by VB like events, controls and drag-and-drop interfaces became bedrock programming concepts thanks to their popularity in VB. 

VB proved coding could be accessible to novices, not just expert developers. Its revolutionary approach inspired C# and languages like Python to also emphasize usability.

So while VB lost its popularity, its pioneering spirit lives on through the many languages that learnt from VB and used its innovations to further democratize programming.
