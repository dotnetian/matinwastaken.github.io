Not long ago, .NET was viewed as a closed-off Microsoft ecosystem. Its potential was constrained by proprietary limitations. But open source changed everything. The vibrant .NET open source community transformed it into a thriving platform poised for future innovation.

In this article, we’ll highlight some of the most impactful open source .NET projects. These community-driven initiatives unlocked .NET and proved its flexibility and power extends far beyond Microsoft's stewardship.

The passion and knowledge of the .NET community is what drives the platform’s evolution today. Their open source contributions make .NET one of the most vibrant platforms for building software. Let's see how.

## Why .NET Loves Open Source

Open source plays a critical role in the .NET ecosystem. Here are some of the key benefits:

- **More Choice**: Open source projects greatly expand available .NET libraries, frameworks, and tools. There are open source options for nearly every task.

- **Community Innovation**: The open source community collectively creates more robust tools than any single organization could. Decentralized development allows new ideas to emerge.

- **Shared Investment**: Companies rely on and contribute to .NET open source projects. This spreads the cost of maintaining and improving these tools.

- **Rapid Evolution**: Open source .NET projects add new features quickly through community collaboration. Closed-source moves slower.

- **Flexibility**: Developers have the freedom to use open source software without restrictive licensing. They can inspect the code to understand how it works.

Clearly, open source strengthens .NET. Even Microsoft now embraces open source for .NET development and contributes to many community projects. The .NET ecosystem thrives because of open source.

## Impactful Open Source .NET Projects

Now let’s explore some widely used open source projects propelling .NET development forward:

### Entity Framework Core

[Entity Framework (EF) Core ↗](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) is a popular object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET. It enables developers to work with databases using .NET objects and eliminates repetitive data access code.

EF Core is a cross-platform rewrite Microsoft open sourced in 2016. It has quickly become the standard for .NET data access.

**Key Benefits:**

- Cross-platform on Linux, macOS, Windows
- Fluent API for configuring entities
- Auto-generate databases from code
- LINQ support for querying
- Provider model supports SQL Server, SQLite, more

### ASP.NET Core

[ASP.NET Core ↗](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet) is a powerful open source web framework for building web apps and APIs. It runs on Windows, macOS and Linux.

Microsoft rebuilt ASP.NET Core as a lightweight, high-performance, and modular framework. First released in 2016, it improves regularly.

**Key Benefits:**

- Build web apps and APIs
- Modular HTTP request pipeline
- Integration with JavaScript frameworks
- Razor syntax for concise coding
- High performance and scalability

### Roslyn

[Roslyn ↗](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) provides open source C# and Visual Basic compilers with rich code analysis APIs. It enables building code analysis tools.

Microsoft open sourced Roslyn in 2014. It powers Visual Studio's compilation and IntelliSense.

**Key Benefits:**

- Open source .NET compiler platform
- Enables code analysis tools
- Powers Visual Studio compilation
- Exposes rich compilation APIs

Roslyn opened up .NET compilers and makes compiler-as-a-service possible.

### Mono

[Mono ↗](https://www.mono-project.com/) is an open source implementation of .NET that enables running .NET applications cross-platform. It can be used to build .NET apps for Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, and more.

**Key Benefits:**

- Cross-platform .NET support
- Allows .NET apps on non-Windows platforms
- Active open source project since 2004
- Powers Xamarin mobile development

Mono enabled .NET to be cross-platform years before .NET Core.

### Blazor

[Blazor ↗](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) enables building interactive web UIs using C# and .NET instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps run on the browser via WebAssembly.

**Key Benefits:**

- Full-stack .NET web development
- Use C# instead of JavaScript
- Share code across server and client
- Integrates with ASP.NET Core backend
- Open source under ASP.NET Core

### ML.NET

[ML.NET ↗](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet) is an open source framework from Microsoft for adding machine learning capabilities to .NET apps. It enables developers to integrate ML models without data science expertise.

**Key Benefits:**

- Incorporate ML into .NET apps
- Cross-platform .NET machine learning
- Pre-trained models for common scenarios
- Automated model creation, optimization, and testing
- Open source under .NET Foundation

## Conclusion

These projects demonstrate the impressive open source momentum behind .NET. Microsoft now embraces open source for .NET, but independent initiatives like these also propel the ecosystem forward. The passion and knowledge of the .NET community drives the platform's evolution and success through open source collaboration.

The days when .NET was a closed-source Microsoft-only platform are long gone. .NET thrives today because of open source.
