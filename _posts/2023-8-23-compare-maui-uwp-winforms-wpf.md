.NET Platform offers numerous tools and technologies to develop applications using .NET languages, typically C#. In this article, we will compare four of the most popular options for creating desktop applications with .NET: .NET MAUI, UWP, Windows Forms, and WPF. We will look at their performance, benefits and limitations, and a brief introduction to each technology. We will also provide some references for further reading.

## .NET MAUI

.NET MAUI stands for .NET Multi-platform App UI. It is an evolution of Xamarin.Forms, a cross-platform framework for building mobile applications with .NET. .NET MAUI extends the capabilities of Xamarin.Forms to support desktop development for Windows and macOS, in addition to iOS and Android. .NET MAUI uses native controls and features for each platform while providing a common API and XAML dialect for UI definition.

### Performance

.NET MAUI is designed to deliver high-performance applications that leverage the native capabilities of each platform. It uses a single project structure and a single binary for all platforms, reducing the size and complexity of the deployment. It also supports hot reload and hot restart features, which enable faster development and testing cycles.

### Benefits

.NET MAUI offers several benefits for desktop development, such as:

- Cross-platform support: You can target multiple platforms with a single codebase and UI definition, reducing the cost and effort of maintaining separate projects.
- Native look and feel: You can create applications that respect the design guidelines and user expectations of each platform while maintaining consistent branding and functionality across devices.
- Modern features: You can access the latest features and APIs of each platform, such as dark mode, touch bar, notifications, etc., through a unified interface.
- Extensibility: You can customize and extend the functionality of .NET MAUI with custom renderers, effects, behaviors, controls, etc., or use existing libraries and components from the Xamarin ecosystem.

### Limitations

.NET MAUI also has some limitations that you should be aware of, such as:

- Platform compatibility: You can only target Windows 10 or later versions for Windows development, and macOS 10.13 or later versions for macOS development. Linux is not supported by .NET MAUI.
- XAML flavor: You have to use the XAML dialect that is compatible with Xamarin.Forms, which is slightly different from the XAML dialects used by UWP and WPF. This may require some learning or migration effort if you are familiar with other XAML frameworks.

## UWP

UWP stands for Universal Windows Platform. It is a platform and a presentation framework for building modern applications that run on Windows 10 devices, such as PCs, tablets, phones, Xbox, HoloLens, etc. UWP provides a rich set of APIs and controls for creating adaptive and responsive UIs that leverage the capabilities of each device.

### Performance

UWP is optimized for performance and reliability on Windows 10 devices. It uses a sandboxed execution model that isolates each application from other applications and system resources, ensuring security and stability. It also supports various features that enhance the user experience, such as background tasks, live tiles, notifications, etc.

### Benefits

UWP offers several benefits for desktop development, such as:

- Modern design: You can create applications that follow the Fluent Design System, which is a set of principles and guidelines for creating beautiful and engaging UIs that work well across devices and input modes.
- Adaptive layout: You can use XAML controls and layout panels that automatically adjust to different screen sizes, resolutions, orientations, etc., ensuring a consistent and optimal UI on any device.
- Device-specific features: You can access device-specific features and APIs through the Windows Runtime API, such as sensors, cameras, pen input, etc., or use extensions to target specific device families, such as Xbox or HoloLens.
- Deployment options: You can deploy your applications through various channels, such as the Microsoft Store, sideloading, or App Installer, depending on your needs and preferences.

### Limitations

UWP also has some limitations that you should be aware of, such as:

- Platform compatibility: You can only target Windows 10 devices for UWP development. Older versions of Windows are not supported by UWP.
- API restrictions: You have to use the APIs that are available in the Windows Runtime API, which may not cover all the scenarios or functionalities that you need. Some legacy or low-level APIs are not accessible from UWP applications.
- Compatibility issues: You may encounter some compatibility issues when integrating with other .NET technologies or libraries, such as WPF, WinForms, or .NET Standard, due to differences in the underlying frameworks and runtime environments.

## Windows Forms

Windows Forms is the oldest and most established UI framework for building desktop applications with .NET. It is based on the native Windows API and provides a set of controls and components for creating traditional Windows-style UIs. Windows Forms is supported on both .NET Framework and .NET.

### Performance

Windows Forms is a mature and stable framework that has been tested and optimized for performance and reliability over the years. It uses native Windows controls and features for rendering and handling UI events, ensuring compatibility and consistency with the operating system. It also supports various features that improve the development and debugging experience, such as designer support, data binding, etc.

### Benefits

Windows Forms offers several benefits for desktop development, such as:

- Simplicity: You can create applications with Windows Forms using a simple and intuitive programming model that is easy to learn and use. You can drag and drop controls from the toolbox, set their properties and events, and write code behind them.
- Flexibility: You can customize and extend the functionality of Windows Forms with custom controls, components, or libraries, or use existing ones from the .NET ecosystem. You can also interoperate with other .NET technologies or native code using related tools.
- Compatibility: You can target multiple versions of Windows for Windows Forms development, from Windows XP to Windows 11. You can also migrate your existing Windows Forms applications from .NET Framework to .NET with minimal changes.

### Limitations

Windows Forms also has some limitations that you should be aware of, such as:

- Design: You can only create applications that follow the classic Windows look and feel, which may not match the modern design trends or user expectations. You have to use third-party libraries or custom controls to achieve a more modern or customized appearance.
- Layout: You have to use absolute or relative positioning for arranging your controls on the form, which may not adapt well to different screen sizes, resolutions, orientations, etc. You have to use additional controls or libraries to achieve a more dynamic or responsive layout.
- Cross-platform support: You can only target Windows devices for Windows Forms development. Other platforms are not supported by Windows Forms.

## WPF

WPF stands for Windows Presentation Foundation. It is a presentation framework for building rich and interactive UIs that leverage the power of DirectX and hardware acceleration. WPF uses XAML as a declarative language for defining UI elements and their properties, behaviors, animations, etc. WPF is supported on both .NET Framework and .NET.

### Performance

WPF is a powerful and flexible framework that enables high-performance applications that take advantage of the graphics capabilities of the hardware and the operating system. It uses a retained mode graphics system that manages the rendering pipeline and optimizes the UI updates. It also supports various features that enhance the user experience, such as 3D graphics, media playback, animations, etc.
