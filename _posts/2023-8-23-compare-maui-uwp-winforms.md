.NET is a versatile and powerful framework for developing applications across multiple platforms, including Windows, Android, iOS, macOS and Samsung Tizen. However, with so many options available, it can be hard to choose the best one for your Windows desktop app. In this article, we will compare three of the most popular choices: .NET MAUI, UWP and Windows Forms.

We will look at the features, benefits and drawbacks of each UI framework, as well as some examples of popular apps and companies that use them. We will also compare their performance in terms of startup time, memory usage and other metrics, using various tools and techniques. By the end of this article, you should have a better understanding of which UI framework suits your app's needs best.

## What is .NET MAUI?

.NET MAUI stands for .NET Multi-platform App UI. It is an evolution of Xamarin.Forms, a cross-platform UI framework that allows you to write your app once and run it on multiple devices. .NET MAUI is part of .NET 6, the latest version of the .NET framework that unifies all the .NET workloads under one SDK.

.NET MAUI enables you to create native Windows apps using WinUI 3, the latest UI framework from Microsoft that provides modern controls, styles and features for Windows 10 and Windows 11. You can also target other platforms like Android, iOS and macOS with the same code base, using native UI components for each platform.

Some of the benefits of using .NET MAUI are:

- Single project: You can manage all your app resources, assets and platform-specific configurations in one project file, instead of having separate projects for each platform.
- Multi-targeting: You can easily switch between different platforms and configurations using Visual Studio or the dotnet CLI.
- Multi-window: You can create multiple windows for your app and handle their lifecycle events.
- Hot reload: You can make changes to your XAML or C# code and see them reflected in your app without restarting it.
- App models: You can choose from different app models to suit your needs, such as MVVM, RxUI, MVU or Blazor.

## What is UWP?

UWP stands for Universal Windows Platform. It is a platform-specific UI framework that allows you to create apps that run on Windows 10 devices, such as PCs, tablets, phones, Xbox, HoloLens and IoT. UWP apps use XAML as their UI markup language and can leverage the full power of the Windows platform, such as notifications, live tiles, Cortana, ink and pen input, etc.

Some of the benefits of using UWP are:

- Modern design: UWP apps follow the Fluent Design System, a set of guidelines and principles that help you create beautiful and engaging user experiences.
- Adaptive layout: UWP apps can automatically adjust to different screen sizes, resolutions and orientations using responsive controls and panels.
- Secure sandbox: UWP apps run in a secure sandbox that protects them from malicious attacks and prevents them from accessing unauthorized resources.
- Store distribution: UWP apps can be easily published to the Microsoft Store, where they can reach millions of users and benefit from automatic updates, ratings and reviews.

## What is Windows Forms?

Windows Forms is a classic UI framework that allows you to create desktop apps for Windows using C# or Visual Basic. Windows Forms apps use Win32 controls as their UI components and can access the full functionality of the Windows API. Windows Forms apps are compatible with .NET Framework, .NET Core and .NET 5-6.

Some of the benefits of using Windows Forms are:

- Familiarity: Windows Forms has been around since .NET Framework 1.0 and has a large community of developers who are familiar with its concepts and tools.
- Simplicity: Windows Forms has a simple drag-and-drop designer that lets you create your UI visually without writing much code.
- Legacy support: Windows Forms can interoperate with legacy technologies such as COM and ActiveX controls, as well as host WPF or WinForms controls in each other.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have compared three UI frameworks for creating Windows desktop apps: .NET MAUI, UWP and Windows Forms. We have seen their features, benefits and drawbacks, as well as some examples of popular apps and companies that use them. We have also compared their performance in terms of startup time, memory usage and other metrics, using various tools and techniques.

We hope that this article has helped you to understand the differences and similarities between these UI frameworks and to choose the best one for your app's needs. However, there is no definitive answer to which UI framework is the best for every scenario. It depends on your requirements, preferences and skills. You may also want to consider other factors such as compatibility, support, community, etc.

Ultimately, the choice is yours. Whatever you choose, .NET provides you with a rich and flexible framework to create amazing Windows desktop apps.
