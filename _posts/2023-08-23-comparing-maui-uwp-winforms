# Comparing .NET MAUI, UWP, and Windows Forms

.NET is a versatile and powerful framework for developing applications across multiple platforms, including Windows, Android, iOS, macOS and Samsung Tizen. However, with so many options available, it can be hard to choose the best one for your Windows desktop app. In this article, we will compare three of the most popular choices: .NET MAUI, UWP and Windows Forms.

## What is .NET MAUI?

.NET MAUI stands for .NET Multi-platform App UI. It is an evolution of Xamarin.Forms, a cross-platform UI framework that allows you to write your app once and run it on multiple devices. .NET MAUI is part of .NET 6, the latest version of the .NET framework that unifies all the .NET workloads under one SDK.

.NET MAUI enables you to create native Windows apps using WinUI 3, the latest UI framework from Microsoft that provides modern controls, styles and features for Windows 10 and Windows 11. You can also target other platforms like Android, iOS and macOS with the same code base, using native UI components for each platform.

Some of the benefits of using .NET MAUI are:

- Single project: You can manage all your app resources, assets and platform-specific configurations in one project file, instead of having separate projects for each platform.
- Multi-targeting: You can easily switch between different platforms and configurations using Visual Studio or the dotnet CLI.
- Multi-window: You can create multiple windows for your app and handle their lifecycle events.
- Hot reload: You can make changes to your XAML or C# code and see them reflected in your app without restarting it.
- App models: You can choose from different app models to suit your needs, such as MVVM, RxUI, MVU or Blazor.

## What is UWP?

UWP stands for Universal Windows Platform. It is a platform-specific UI framework that allows you to create apps that run on Windows 10 devices, such as PCs, tablets, phones, Xbox, HoloLens and IoT. UWP apps use XAML as their UI markup language and can leverage the full power of the Windows platform, such as notifications, live tiles, Cortana, ink and pen input, etc.

Some of the benefits of using UWP are:

- Modern design: UWP apps follow the Fluent Design System, a set of guidelines and principles that help you create beautiful and engaging user experiences.
- Adaptive layout: UWP apps can automatically adjust to different screen sizes, resolutions and orientations using responsive controls and panels.
- Secure sandbox: UWP apps run in a secure sandbox that protects them from malicious attacks and prevents them from accessing unauthorized resources.
- Store distribution: UWP apps can be easily published to the Microsoft Store, where they can reach millions of users and benefit from automatic updates, ratings and reviews.

## What is Windows Forms?

Windows Forms is a classic UI framework that allows you to create desktop apps for Windows using C# or Visual Basic. Windows Forms apps use Win32 controls as their UI components and can access the full functionality of the Windows API. Windows Forms apps are compatible with .NET Framework, .NET Core and .NET 5-6.

Some of the benefits of using Windows Forms are:

- Familiarity: Windows Forms has been around since .NET Framework 1.0 and has a large community of developers who are familiar with its concepts and tools.
- Simplicity: Windows Forms has a simple drag-and-drop designer that lets you create your UI visually without writing much code.
- Legacy support: Windows Forms can interoperate with legacy technologies such as COM and ActiveX controls, as well as host WPF or WinForms controls in each other.

## How to compare performance?

Performance is an important aspect of any application, especially for desktop apps that need to be responsive and efficient. Performance can be measured in different ways, such as startup time, memory usage, CPU usage, battery consumption, etc. Depending on your app's scenario and target audience, you may want to optimize for different performance metrics.

To compare the performance of .NET MAUI, UWP and Windows Forms apps on Windows 10 or 11 devices, you can use various tools and techniques such as:

- BenchmarkDotNet: A powerful library for benchmarking .NET code that supports various runtimes (including Mono), platforms (including Android and iOS) and metrics (including memory allocation).
- Visual Studio Diagnostics Tools: A set of tools integrated in Visual Studio that help you analyze the performance of your app during debugging or profiling sessions. You can use tools such as CPU Usage, Memory Usage, GPU Usage, Energy Consumption, etc.
- PerfView: A low-overhead tool for collecting performance data on Windows systems. You can use it to collect CPU samples, memory allocations, events, etc. and analyze them using various views and reports.
- Windows Performance Analyzer: A tool that can visualize and analyze system and application performance data captured by Windows Performance Recorder. You can use it to examine CPU usage, disk I/O, memory usage, etc. and identify performance bottlenecks.

Using these tools, you can collect and compare performance data for different UI frameworks and make informed decisions about which one suits your app's needs best.
